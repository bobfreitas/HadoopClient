HadoopClient
============

Client to experiment with submitting Hadoop and Pig jobs to a cluster.  
It is based on Hadoop 1.0.4 and Pig 0.11.0.  It is intended to provide 
examples of how to submit jobs from a client application in Java.  

None of the command line options have been built out.  It is intended 
to be run in Eclipse to allow for easy debugging.  In addition, it may
require some additional runtime libraries.
